### Geocomputation

- **GIS** - A **G**eographic **I**nformation **S**ystem - analysis, manipulation and visualization of geographical data (Longley, Goodchild, Maguire, and Rhind, 2015)
- GIS software - GRASS GIS, SAGA GIS, QGIS, ArcGIS (commercial)

```{r gdsl, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
d = readr::read_csv("figs/gis-vs-gds-table.csv")
knitr::kable(x = d, format = "html")
```

- Geographic data is represented by **spatial coordinates**
- There are many **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**, which defines how the spatial elements of the data relate to the surface of the Earth (or other bodies)
- There are two main models for representing geographic data - the **vector** and the **raster** data model

---
### Spatial R history

- Spatial packages already available in the S language since the 1990s (Bivand and Gebhardt, 2000)
- By 2000, modifications of these became R packages for point pattern analysis, geostatistics, exploratory - spatial data analysis and spatial econometrics
- R-GIS bridges (Bivand, 2000)
- Bivand (2003) proposed a spatial data class system for R which eventually led to the packages **rgdal** (first released in 2003; Bivand, Keitt, and Rowlingson, 2018) and **sp** (first released in 2005; Bivand, Pebesma, and Gomez-Rubio, 2013)
- 2008: *Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R* (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gomez-Rubio, 2013)
- 2010: **raster** package (Hijmans, 2017)
- 2011: **rgeos** package (Bivand and Rundel, 2017)
- 2014-15: Spatial visualization - **tmap** (Tennekes, 2018), **rasterVis** (Lamigueiro, 2014), **leaflet** (Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie, 2018)
- 2016-17: **sf** - simple features for R (Pebesma, 2018a)
- 2017-18: **stars** - spatiotemporal tidy arrays for R (Pebesma, 2018b)

### Spatial R

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
library(raster)
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(tmap)

p1 = tm_shape(lnd) +
        tm_polygons("NAME", legend.show = FALSE) +
        tm_layout(title = "Vector")
p2 = tm_shape(elev) +
        tm_raster("layer", legend.show = FALSE, n = 36)  +
        tm_layout(title = "Raster")
tmap_arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

- **sf** and **sp** are the most important R packages to handle vector data; **sf** is a successor of **sp** but its still evolving. Moreover, many other R packages depend on the functions and classes for the **sp** package
- **raster** is an extension of spatial data classes to work with rasters
- It is also easy to connect R with a GIS software - GRASS GIS (**rgrass7**), SAGA GIS (**RSAGA**), QGIS (**RQGIS** and **qgisremote**), and ArcGIS (**arcgisbinding**)

### The **sf** package

The **sf** package in an R implementation of [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features). This package incorporates:
- A relatively new spatial data class system in R
- Functions for reading and writing data
- Tools for spatial operations on vectors

Most of the functions in this package start with a prefix `st_`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r-spatial/sf") # development version
```

or

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf") # stable version
```

You need a recent version of the GDAL, GEOS, Proj.4, and UDUNITS libraries installed for this to work on Mac and Linux. More information on that at https://github.com/r-spatial/sf.

### How to put this data on the map?

- I've got some non-spatial data
- How can I **add spatial information to my data**?
- How to visualize my locations on a map?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(readr)
breweries = c("Listermann Brewing Company",
              "Rhinegeist Brewery",
              "The Woodburn Brewery",
              "Urban Artifact")
no_beer = c(999, 5155, 3111, 710)
revenue = c(7986, 4651, 5156, 8847)
profit = c(513, 651, 879, 634)

my_df = data_frame(brewery = breweries, no_of_beers = no_beer, 
                   revenue = revenue, profit = profit)
write_csv(my_df, "breweries.csv")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
my_df = read_csv("breweries.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(my_df, format = "html")
```

> Note: All the data presented here (except the names) are artificial!

---
### Spatial data

- Usually, spatial files are stored in special data formats, such as ESRI Shapefile (.shp) or **GeoPackage (.gpkg)**
- Vector data can be represented by areas (**polygons**), **lines**, or **points**

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
breweries = c("Listermann Brewing Company",
              "Rhinegeist Brewery",
              "The Woodburn Brewery",
              "Urban Artifact")
breweries_df1 = data_frame(name = breweries[1:2],
                    x = c(1331125, 1327662), 
                    y = c(-525580, -529531.6))
breweries_sf1 = st_as_sf(breweries_df1, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 2163)
st_write(breweries_sf1, "breweries_sf1.gpkg")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
breweries_sf1 = st_read("breweries_sf1.gpkg", quiet = TRUE)
breweries_sf1
```

---
### Geocode

- Only two of my locations exist in my spatial file
- How can I get coordinates of my missing breweries? 
- The answer is **geocoding** - converting names/addresses into spatial coordinates

```{r geocode, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(ggmap)
breweries_df2 = data_frame(name = c("The Woodburn Brewery",
                                    "Urban Artifact"))
breweries_df2 = mutate_geocode(breweries_df2, name)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# readr::write_csv(breweries_df2, "breweries_coords.csv")
breweries_df2 = readr::read_csv("breweries_coords.csv")
```

```{r}
breweries_df2
```

- Also try the **opencage** package - https://github.com/ropensci/opencage 


---
### Convert to spatial object

```{r}
breweries_df2
breweries_sf2 = st_as_sf(breweries_df2,
                         coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)
breweries_sf2
```

---
### Unify and combine

- Transform to the same spatial projection (`st_transform`) and unify the columns names (`rename`):

```{r}
breweries_sf1 = st_transform(breweries_sf1,
                             crs = st_crs(breweries_sf2))
breweries_sf1 = dplyr::rename(breweries_sf1, geometry = geom)
```

- Bind the spatial datasets (`rbind`):

```{r}
breweries_sf = rbind(breweries_sf1, breweries_sf2)
breweries_sf
```

---
### Join

- Join the spatial and non-spatial datasets:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
my_breweries = left_join(breweries_sf, my_df, 
                         by = c("name" = "brewery"))
my_breweries
```

---
### Plot

- There are several ways to visualize spatial data in R - as a static map (*plot()*, **ggplot2**, **tmap**) and interactive one (**leaflet**, **mapview**, **tmap**)

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
library(mapview)
mapview(my_breweries)
```
