## Welcome to **geocomp*x***!

::: {.justify}

Here you will find content, including books and beyond, on reproducible geographic data analysis, modeling, and visualization with open source software.

The **geocomp*x*** project is a community-driven effort to provide resources for learning and teaching about geocomputation in multiple programming languages.
It is about *eXchanging information* about geocomputation, *cross (X) pollination of ideas* from one programming language for working with geographic data to another, and hosting additional content on *geocomputation with (X) other languages*.

The project and this website evolved from the website originally created to host content around [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/). 
Since the publication of that book in 2019, the community around the book has grown and now includes a nascent 'geocompy' community and the associated [Geocomputation with Python](https://py.geocompx.org/) open source book project.
It became clear that the 'geocompr' name was no longer appropriate for the more multi-lingual nature of the project.
