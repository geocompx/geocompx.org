## A new post

To add a new post, find a subfolder in the `post` directory that corresponds to the year of the post. 
If it does not exist, create a new subfolder with the current year.
Then, create a new folder in that subfolder with a short name for the post, such as `my-new-post`.
In that folder, create a new file named `index.qmd` and add the content of the post in Quarto format -- you can use the [`index.qmd`](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompx.org/blob/main/post/2025/sml-bp1/index.qmd) file from one of the existing posts as a template.

If you want to add any images, you can add them directly in your post folder.
