We are excited to announce that the second edition of [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/) is (almost) complete.
It tooks us more than two and a half years to update the book.
This blog post summarizes the process and list things we added and changed.
It also mentions what is left to do.

## Geocomputation with R

If you are not familiar with the book, here is a brief introduction (skip this section if you already know the book).
Geocomputation with R (<https://r.geocompx.org/>) is a book about geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling in a reproducible manner.
It is aimed at people who want to learn how to use R to work with geographic data, so the book is designed to be accessible to people with no prior experience in spatial data processing in R.

The book is divided into three parts: foundations, extensions, and applications.
The first part covers the basics of spatial data and the R ecosystem for working with it.
It shows how to read, write, and manipulate both spatial vector and raster data using packages such as **sf** and **terra**.
This part also explains the topics of spherical geometries, geographic data sources, and coordinate reference systems.
The second part of the book covers more advanced topics, such as customized mapping, connecting R with GIS software and cloud services, and machine learning for spatial data.
The third part of the book is about applications of geocomputation, including transportation, geomarketing, and ecology.
It shows how to use R to solve real-world problems in these fields.

The book is designed to be practical and hands-on: it contains many examples and exercises.
The book is also open-source, so you can contribute to it by submitting a pull request or opening an issue on GitHub.

## What's are the biggest changes?

The first edition of the book was published in 2019.
Since then, the R ecosystem has changed a lot: the **terra** package was introduced for working with raster data, the **sf** package started to support operations on spherical geometries, proj-string used to define coordinate reference systems was replaced by WKT2 and SRID, and a new major version of the **tmap** package was released.
Many other packages were also updated, and new ones were created.
The second edition of the book reflects these changes.

Writing the second edition of the book was a long and complex process.
We made about 2,500 commits to the book's repository, which resulted in more than 23,000 changed lines of code and prose.

There are some major changes in the second edition of the book that affect the structure and content of the whole book.
One of such changes it the replacement of the **raster** package with the **terra** package for working with raster data.
The **terra** package is similar to its predecessor, but it is generally faster and more adjusted to working with large datasets.
Its functions are often similar to those in **raster**, but there are also some differences that needed to be addressed in the book.

Another major change is the addition of information about spherical geometry operations available in the **sf** package in a few places in the book.
It includes new sections in Chapter 2 and Chapter 7.
Nowadays, the **sf** package supports operations on spherical geometries by default when the input data is in a geographic coordinate reference system.
This has a big impact on spatial operations, such as buffering, distance calculations, and area calculations, and it is important to understand how to use it properly.

Spatial operations related to projections and coordinate reference systems in many software tools are using a library called PROJ.
This library undergone breaking changes that started in 2018, and affected many spatial data workflows.
The second edition of the book reflects these changes by using the new WKT2 and SRID format for defining coordinate reference systems, and by updating the examples, explanations, and exercises to use the new format.

Most figures in the second edition were remade using the version 4 of the **tmap** package.
The new version of the package has a different syntax and new features, allowing for more customization and better-looking maps.
Therefore, we also updated the whole chapter about mapping to reflect the changes in the package.

Other general changes in the book include the addition of [a new website with the book solutions](/post/2022/geocompr-solutions/), replacing the magrittr pipe `%>%` with the native R pipe `|>`, and [our new book cover](/post/2024/cover-competition-results/).

## What's new?

Many major new additions are also present in the second edition of the book.
We added several new graphs to ease the understanding of the concepts, such as the one below that shows the process of creating an `sf` object from hand.

![](02-sfdiagram.png)

[The "Bridges to GIS software" chapter](https://r.geocompx.org/gis) was rewritten and expanded, with the new packages made available since the first edition, such as **qgisprocess**, **Rsagacmd**, and **rgrass**.
Similarly, [the "Statistical learning" chapter](https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-cv) was redone, with the new code based on the **mlr3** package.

[The "Transportation" chapter](https://r.geocompx.org/transport) was also completely rewritten, with new sections on routes, and route networks.

The book also gained many new sections, including ones on construction and manipulation of `sf` object using [the **sfheaders** package](https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-class#sfheaders), on smoothing the boundaries of polygon and linestring geometries using [the **smoothr** package](https://r.geocompx.org/geometry-operations#simplification), on creating [geographic metadata](https://r.geocompx.org/read-write#geographic-metadata),  and on connecting R with [cloud services](https://r.geocompx.org/gis#cloud).

The above changes are just a few examples of the many new things that were added to the book -- there are many more new sections, examples, and exercises that were added to the book!
<!-- New chapter on raster-vector interactions split out from Chapter 5-->
<!-- https://r.geocompx.org/reproj-geo-data#mapproj -->
<!-- reorder of Geographic data I/O, COG, vsicurl, new Geographic data packages (examples), Geographic metadata, Geographic web services (thanks)  -->
<!-- new conclusions -->
<!-- tons of small changes -->

<!-- ## What's next? -->
<!-- add this part when we know the publication date -->
<!-- final changes, proofreading, and publication -->
