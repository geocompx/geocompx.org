This is the third part of a blog post series on spatial machine learning with R.

You can find the list of other blog posts in this series [in part one](post/2025/sml-bp1/).

## Introduction

In this blog post, we will show how to use the **tidymodels** framework for spatial machine learning.
The **tidymodels** framework is a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning using *tidyverse* principles.

## Prepare data

```{r}
#| results: hide
#| message: false
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(tidymodels)
library(ranger)
library(dplyr)
library(spatialsample)
library(waywiser)
library(vip)
```

Read data:

```{r}
#| results: hide
#| message: false
trainingdata <- sf::st_read("https://github.com/LOEK-RS/FOSSGIS2025-examples/raw/refs/heads/main/data/temp_train.gpkg")
predictors <- terra::rast("https://github.com/LOEK-RS/FOSSGIS2025-examples/raw/refs/heads/main/data/predictors.tif")
```

Prepare data:

```{r}
#| results: hide
#| message: false
trainDat <- sf::st_as_sf(terra::extract(predictors, trainingdata, bind = TRUE))
predictor_names <- names(predictors) # Extract predictor names from the raster
response_name <- "temp"
```

Compared to **caret**, no dropping of the geometries is required

## A simple model training and prediction

First, we train a random forest model.
This is done by defining a recipe and a model, and then combining them into a workflow.
Such a workflow can then be used to fit the model to the data.

```{r}
# Define the recipe
formula <- as.formula(paste(
    response_name,
    "~",
    paste(predictor_names, collapse = " + ")
))
recipe <- recipes::recipe(formula, data = trainDat)

rf_model <- parsnip::rand_forest(trees = 100, mode = "regression") |>
    set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity")

# Create the workflow
workflow <- workflows::workflow() |>
    workflows::add_recipe(recipe) |>
    workflows::add_model(rf_model)

# Fit the model
rf_fit <- parsnip::fit(workflow, data = trainDat)
```

Now let's use the model for spatial prediction with `terra::predict()`.

```{r}
prediction_raster <- terra::predict(predictors, rf_fit)
plot(prediction_raster)
```

## Spatial cross-validation

Cross-validation requires to specify how the data is split into folds.
Here, we define a non-spatial cross-validation with `rsample::vfold_cv()` and a spatial cross-validation with `spatialsample::spatial_block_cv()`.

```{r}
random_folds <- rsample::vfold_cv(trainDat, v = 4)
block_folds <- spatialsample::spatial_block_cv(trainDat, v = 4, n = 2)
spatialsample::autoplot(block_folds)

# control cross-validation
keep_pred <- tune::control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE, save_workflow = TRUE)
```

Next, we fit the model to the data using cross-validation with `tune::fit_resamples()`.

```{r}
### Cross-validation
rf_random <- tune::fit_resamples(
    workflow,
    resamples = random_folds,
    control = keep_pred
)
rf_spatial <- tune::fit_resamples(
    workflow,
    resamples = block_folds,
    control = keep_pred
)

### get CV metrics
# rf_spatial$.metrics # metrics from each fold
tune::collect_metrics(rf_random)
tune::collect_metrics(rf_spatial)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
### analyze CV predictions
rf_spatial_pred <- data.frame(
    tune::collect_predictions(rf_spatial),
    type = "spatial"
)
rf_random_pred <- data.frame(
    tune::collect_predictions(rf_random),
    type = "random"
)
pred_cv <- rbind(rf_spatial_pred, rf_random_pred)
pred_cv |>
    ggplot(aes(x = temp, y = .pred)) +
    facet_wrap("type") +
    geom_point(alpha = .15) +
    geom_abline(color = "red") +
    coord_obs_pred() +
    ylab("Predicted")
```

::: callout-note
Similar to **caret**, we first define folds and a definition of train control. 
The final model, however, is still stored in a separate object.

## Model tuning: spatial hyperparameter tuning and variable selection

### Hyperparameter tuning

Next, we tune the model hyperparameters.
For this, we change the workflow to include the tuning specifications by using the `tune()` function inside the model definition and define a grid of hyperparameters to search over.
The tuning is done with `tune::tune_grid()`.

```{r}
# mark two parameters for tuning:
rf_model <- parsnip::rand_forest(
    trees = 100,
    mode = "regression",
    mtry = tune(),
    min_n = tune()
) |>
    set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity")

workflow <- update_model(workflow, rf_model)

# define tune grid:
grid_rf <-
    grid_space_filling(
        mtry(range = c(1, 20)),
        min_n(range = c(2, 10)),
        size = 30
    )

# tune:
rf_tuning <- tune_grid(
    workflow,
    resamples = block_folds,
    grid = grid_rf,
    control = keep_pred
)
```

The results can be extracted with `collect_metrics()` and then visualized.

```{r}
rf_tuning |>
    collect_metrics()

rf_tuning |>
    collect_metrics() |>
    mutate(min_n = factor(min_n)) |>
    ggplot(aes(mtry, mean, color = min_n)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, alpha = 0.6) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    facet_wrap(~.metric, scales = "free", nrow = 2) +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number()) +
    scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", begin = .9, end = 0)
```

Finally, we can extract the best model and use it to get the variable importance and make predictions.

```{r}
finalmodel <- fit_best(rf_tuning)
finalmodel

imp <- extract_fit_parsnip(finalmodel) |>
    vip::vip()
imp

final_pred <- terra::predict(predictors, finalmodel)
plot(final_pred)
```

### Feature selection

Still missing: <https://stevenpawley.github.io/recipeselectors/>

## Area of Applicability, Uncertainties etc

<https://applicable.tidymodels.org/>, <https://docs.ropensci.org/waywiser/>

```{r}
model_aoa <- waywiser::ww_area_of_applicability(
    st_drop_geometry(trainDat[, predictor_names]),
    importance = vip::vi_model(finalmodel)
)

AOA <- terra::predict(predictors, model_aoa)
plot(AOA$di)
plot(AOA$aoa)
```
