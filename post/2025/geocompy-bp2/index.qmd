*Geocomputation with Python* (***geocompy***) is an open-source introductory resource for working with geographic data with Python.
It covers the entire range of standard GIS operations for both vector and raster data models and provides a consistent learning curve.
The book is designed to minimize surprises, with each section and chapter building on the previous.
If you're just starting out with Python to work with geographic data, we hope that the book will be an excellent place to start.

The book is open-source, and you can find the code underlying the *geocompy* project on [GitHub](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompy).
This ensures that the content is reproducible, transparent, and accessible.
It also lets you interact with the project by opening issues and submitting pull requests.

**Geocompy** would not be possible without the support of the open-source community.
We want to thank the authors and contributors of the **numpy**, **pandas**, **shapely**, **geopandas**, and **rasterio** packages, which are used extensively in the book, for building these wonderful tools.
We also acknowledge the open-source community's contributions during the book's development, including Will Deakin, Sean Gillies, Josh Cole, and Jt Miclat.
Many thanks also to Jannes Muenchow, whose work was essential for parts of the book.
