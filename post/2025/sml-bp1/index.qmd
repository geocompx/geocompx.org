The R language has a variety of packages for machine learning, and many of them can be used for machine learning tasks in a spatial context (*spatial machine learning*).
Spatial machine learning is generally different from traditional machine learning, as variables located closer to each other are often more similar than those located further apart.
Thus, we need to consider that when building machine learning models.

In this blog post, we compare three of the most popular machine learning frameworks in R: **caret**, **tidymodels**, and **mlr3**.
We use a simple example to demonstrate how to use these frameworks for a spatial machine learning task and how their workflows differ.
The goal here is to provide a general sense of how the spatial machine learning workflow looks like, and how different frameworks can be used to achieve the same goal.

# Inputs

Our task is to predict the temperature in Spain using a set of covariates. 
We have two datasets for that purpose: the first one, `temperature_train`, contains the temperature measurements from 195 locations in Spain, and the second one, `predictor_stack`, contains the covariates we will use to predict the temperature.^[Source of the data: Mil√† et al. (2024), https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6007-2024]
These covariates include variables such as population density (`popdens`), distance to the coast (`coast`), and elevation (`elev`), among others.

```{r index-2}
library(terra)
library(sf)
train_points <- sf::read_sf("https://github.com/LOEK-RS/FOSSGIS2025-examples/raw/refs/heads/main/data/temp_train.gpkg")
predictor_stack <- terra::rast("https://github.com/LOEK-RS/FOSSGIS2025-examples/raw/refs/heads/main/data/predictors.tif")
```

We use a subset of fourteen of the available covariates to predict the temperature.
But before doing that, to prepare our data for modeling, we need to extract the covariate values at the locations of our training points.

```{r index-3}
predictor_names <- names(predictor_stack)[1:14]
temperature_train <- terra::extract(predictor_stack[[predictor_names]],
    train_points,
    bind = TRUE
) |>
    sf::st_as_sf()
```

Now, our `temperature_train` dataset contains the temperature measurements and the covariate values at each location and is ready for modeling.

# Loading packages

Using each of the frameworks requires loading the respective packages.

# Model specification

Each of the frameworks has its own way of setting up the modeling workflow.
This may include defining the model, the resampling method, and the hyperparameter values^[Or the hyperparameter tuning grid, in a more advanced scenario.].
In this example, we use random forest models as implemented in the **ranger** package with the following hyperparameters:

- `mtry`: the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split of 8
- `splitrule`: the splitting rule of `"extratrees"`
- `min.node.size`: the minimum size of terminal nodes of 5

We also use a spatial cross-validation method with 5 folds.
It means that the data is divided into many spatial blocks, and each block is assigned to a fold.
The model is trained on a set of blocks belonging to the training set and evaluated on the remaining blocks.
Note that each framework has its own way of defining the resampling method, and thus, the implementation and the folds may differ slightly.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## caret

For **caret**, we define the hyperparameter grid using the `expand.grid()` function, and the resampling method using the `trainControl()` function.
In this case, to use spatial cross-validation, we use the `blockCV` package to create the folds, and then pass them to the `trainControl()` function.

```{r index-7}
set.seed(22)
# hyperparameters
tn_grid <- expand.grid(
    mtry = 8,
    splitrule = "extratrees",
    min.node.size = 5
)

# resampling
spatial_blocks <- blockCV::cv_spatial(
    temperature_train,
    k = 5,
    hexagon = FALSE,
    progress = FALSE
)
train_ids <- lapply(spatial_blocks$folds_list, function(x) x[[1]])
test_ids <- lapply(spatial_blocks$folds_list, function(x) x[[2]])

tr_control <- caret::trainControl(
    method = "cv",
    index = train_ids,
    indexOut = test_ids,
    savePredictions = TRUE
)
```

## tidymodels

In **tidymodels**, the steps are to:

1. Specify the modeling formula using the `recipe()` function.
2. Define the model using a function from the **parsnip** package, including the hyperparameters.
3. Create a workflow using the `workflow()` function, which combines the recipe and the model.
4. Define the resampling method using the `spatial_block_cv()` function from the **spatialsample** package.

```{r index-8}
set.seed(22)
form <- as.formula(paste0("temp ~ ", paste(predictor_names, collapse = " + ")))
recipe <- recipes::recipe(form, data = temperature_train)

rf_model <- parsnip::rand_forest(
    trees = 100,
    mtry = 8,
    min_n = 5,
    mode = "regression"
) |>
    set_engine("ranger", splitrule = "extratrees", importance = "impurity")

workflow <- workflows::workflow() |>
    workflows::add_recipe(recipe) |>
    workflows::add_model(rf_model)

block_folds <- spatialsample::spatial_block_cv(temperature_train, v = 5)
spatialsample::autoplot(block_folds)
```

## mlr3

The basic **mlr3** steps are connected to its terminology:

1. **Task**: define the task using the `as_task_regr_st()` function, which specifies the target variable and the data.
2. **Learner**: define the model using the `lrn()` function, which specifies the model type and the hyperparameters.
3. **Resampling**: define the resampling method using the `rsmp()` function, which specifies the type of resampling and the number of folds.
Here, we use the `spcv_block` resampling method.

```{r index-9}
set.seed(22)
task <- mlr3spatiotempcv::as_task_regr_st(temperature_train, target = "temp")
learner <- mlr3::lrn("regr.ranger",
    num.trees = 100,
    importance = "impurity",
    mtry = 8,
    min.node.size = 5,
    splitrule = "extratrees"
)
resampling <- mlr3::rsmp("spcv_block",
    folds = 5,
    cols = 10, rows = 10
)
```

:::

# Modeling

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## caret

The main function of the **caret** package is `train()`, which takes the formula, the data, the model type, the tuning grid, the training control (including the resampling method), and some other arguments (e.g., the number of trees).
The `train()` function will automatically perform the resampling and hyperparameter tuning (if applicable).
The final model is stored in the `finalModel` object.

```{r index-10}
model_caret <- caret::train(
    temp ~ .,
    data = st_drop_geometry(temperature_train),
    method = "ranger",
    tuneGrid = tn_grid,
    trControl = tr_control,
    num.trees = 100,
    importance = "impurity"
)
model_caret_final <- model_caret$finalModel
```

## tidymodels

In **tidymodels**, the `fit_resamples()` function takes the previously defined workflow and the resampling folds.
Here, we also use the `control` argument to save the predictions and the workflow, which can be useful for later analysis.
The `fit_best()` function is used to fit the best model based on the resampling results.
    
```{r index-11}
rf_spatial <- tune::fit_resamples(
    workflow,
    resamples = block_folds,
    control = tune::control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE, save_workflow = TRUE)
)
model_tidymodels <- fit_best(rf_spatial)
```

## mlr3

The **mlr3** workflow applies the `resample()` function to the task, the learner, and the resampling method.
Then, to get the final model, we use the `train()` function on previously defined task and learner.

```{r index-12}
model_mlr3 <- mlr3::resample(
    task = task,
    learner = learner,
    resampling = resampling
)
learner$train(task)
```

:::

# Evaluation

After the models are trained, we want to evaluate their performance.
Here, we use two of the most common metrics for regression tasks: the root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R^2^).

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## caret

RMSE and R^2^ are calculated by default in **caret**.
The performance metrics are then stored in the `results` object of the model.

```{r index-13}
model_caret$results
```

## tidymodels

RMSE and R^2^ are calculated by default in **tidymodels**.
The performance metrics are extracted from the resampling results using the `collect_metrics()` function.

```{r index-14}
tune::collect_metrics(rf_spatial)
```

## mlr3

We need to specify the measures we want to calculate using the `msr()` function.
Then, the `aggregate()` method is used to calculate the selected performance metrics.

```{r index-15}
my_measures <- c(mlr3::msr("regr.rmse"), mlr3::msr("regr.rsq"))
model_mlr3$aggregate(measures = my_measures)
```

:::

# Prediction

Our goal is to predict the temperature in Spain using the covariates from the `predictor_stack` dataset.
Thus, we want to obtain a map of the predicted temperature values for the entire country.
The `predict()` function of the **terra** package makes model predictions on the new raster data.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## caret

```{r index-16}
pred_caret <- terra::predict(predictor_stack, model_caret, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(pred_caret)
```

## tidymodels

```{r index-17}
pred_tidymodels <- terra::predict(predictor_stack, model_tidymodels, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(pred_tidymodels)
```

## mlr3
```{r index-18}
pred_mlr3 <- terra::predict(predictor_stack, learner, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(pred_mlr3)
```

# Area of applicability

The area of applicability (AoA) is a method to assess the what is the area of the input space that is similar to the training data.
It is a useful tool to evaluate the model performance and to identify the areas where the model can be applied.
Areas outside the AoA are considered to be outside the model's applicability domain, and thus, the predictions in these areas should be interpreted with caution or not used at all.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## caret

The AoA method's original implementation is in the **CAST** package -- a package that extends the **caret** package.
The AoA is calculated using the `aoa()` function, which takes the new data (the covariates) and the model as input.

```{r index-19}
AOA_caret <- CAST::aoa(
    newdata = predictor_stack,
    model = model_caret,
    verbose = FALSE
)
plot(AOA_caret$AOA)
```

## tidymodels

The **waywiser** package implements the AoA method for **tidymodels**^[It is not a wrapper for the **CAST** package, but a separate implementation with some differences as you may read in the function documentation -- `?ww_area_of_applicability`].
The `ww_area_of_applicability()` function takes the training data and variable importance as input.
Then, to obtain the AoA, we use the `predict()` function from the **terra** package.^[Thus, this approach allow to check the AoA for each new data set, not only the training data.]

```{r index-20}
model_aoa <- waywiser::ww_area_of_applicability(
    st_drop_geometry(temperature_train[, predictor_names]),
    importance = vip::vi_model(model_tidymodels)
)
AOA_tidymodels <- terra::predict(predictor_stack, model_aoa)
plot(AOA_tidymodels$aoa)
```

## mlr3

The **CAST** package can calculate the AoA for **mlr3** models.
However, then we need to specify various arguments, such as a raster with covariates, the training data, the variables to be used, the weights of the variables, and the cross-validation folds.

```{r index-21}
rsmp_cv <- resampling$instantiate(task)

AOA_mlr3 <- CAST::aoa(
    newdata = predictor_stack,
    train = as.data.frame(task$data()),
    variables = task$feature_names,
    weight = data.frame(t(learner$importance())),
    CVtest = rsmp_cv$instance[order(row_id)]$fold,
    verbose = FALSE
)
plot(AOA_mlr3$AOA)
```

# Conclusion

In this blog post, we compared three of the most popular machine learning frameworks in R: **caret**, **tidymodels**, and **mlr3**.
We demonstrated how to use these frameworks for a spatial machine learning task, including model specification, training, evaluation, prediction, and obtaining the area of applicability.

There is a lot of overlap in functionality between the three frameworks.
Simultaneously, the frameworks differ in their design philosophy and implementation.
Some, as **caret**, are more focused on providing a consistent and concise interface, but it offers limited flexibility.
Others, like **tidymodels** and **mlr3**, are more modular and flexible, allowing for more complex workflows and customizations, which also makes them more complex to learn and use.

Many additional steps can be added to the presented workflow, such as feature engineering, variable selection, hyperparameter tuning, model interpretation, and more.
In the next blog posts, we will show these three frameworks in more detail, and then also present some other packages that can be used for spatial machine learning in R.
