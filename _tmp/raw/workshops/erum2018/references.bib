  abstract = {{"}Effective use of today's powerful GIS technology requires an understanding of the science of problem-solving that underpins it. Since the first edition published over a decade ago, this book has led the way, with its focus on the scientific principles that support GIS usage. It has also provided thorough, upto- date coverage of GIS procedures, techniques and public policy applications. This unique combination of science, technology and practical problem solving has made this book a best-seller across a broad spectrum of disciplines. This fully updated 4th edition continues to deliver on these strengths{"}--},
